As an AI, I'm unable to fetch real-time data or create a CSV file. However, I can provide a Python script that can be used to fetch the data and create the `nyse_stocks.csv` file. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd
import yfinance as yf

# List of NYSE stocks (you need to provide this)
nyse_stocks = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", ...]

# Create an empty DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame()

# Fetch the data for each stock
for stock in nyse_stocks:
    data = yf.Ticker(stock)
    info = data.info
    df = df.append(info, ignore_index=True)

# Save the data to a CSV file
df.to_csv('data/nyse_stocks.csv', index=False)
```

This script uses the `yfinance` library to fetch the data for each stock listed on the NYSE and saves it to a CSV file. You need to provide the list of NYSE stocks.
