1. Dependencies: All Python files will require the pandas, numpy, and sklearn libraries for data manipulation and machine learning. The web application will be built using Flask, so this will be a shared dependency across all Python files. The JavaScript files will require jQuery and D3.js for DOM manipulation and data visualization.

2. Data Schemas: The data schemas for the NYSE and NASDAQ stocks will be shared across the screener, backtester, and forecast models. These schemas will define the structure of the stock data, including fields like 'ticker', 'company', 'sector', 'industry', 'country', 'market cap', 'P/E', 'price', 'change', 'volume'.

3. DOM Element IDs: The JavaScript files will interact with the HTML templates through various DOM elements. Shared IDs might include 'screener-table', 'backtester-chart', 'forecast-chart', 'submit-button', 'reset-button', 'ticker-input', 'date-range-input'.

4. Message Names: Messages sent between the client and server might include 'screener-request', 'backtester-request', 'forecast-request', 'screener-response', 'backtester-response', 'forecast-response'.

5. Function Names: Shared function names across the JavaScript files might include 'submitForm', 'resetForm', 'updateTable', 'updateChart'. The Python files might share functions like 'loadData', 'preprocessData', 'trainModel', 'predict'. 

6. Exported Variables: The Python files might export trained models for use in other parts of the application. These could be named 'screener_model', 'backtester_model', 'forecast_model'. The JavaScript files might export functions for use in other scripts. 

7. Dockerfile: This file will contain instructions for building the Docker image of the application. It will share dependencies with the Python and JavaScript files, as it needs to install the necessary libraries and frameworks for the application to run. 

8. CSS: The 'style.css' file will contain the styling for the HTML templates. It will share class and id names with the HTML and JavaScript files. 

9. HTML Templates: These files will contain the structure of the web pages. They will share id and class names with the CSS and JavaScript files.
