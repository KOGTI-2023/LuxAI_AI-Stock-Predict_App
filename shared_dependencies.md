The shared dependencies between the "docker-compose.yml" and "README.md" files are:

1. Service Names: The names of the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file will be referenced in the README.md file to explain their purpose and how to interact with them.

2. Environment Variables: Any environment variables defined in the docker-compose.yml file will also be mentioned in the README.md file, as users will need to know what they are and potentially how to set them.

3. Ports: The ports that are exposed by the services in the docker-compose.yml file will be documented in the README.md file, so users know which ports to use when interacting with the application.

4. Volumes: Any volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file will be documented in the README.md file, so users understand where data is stored.

5. Dependencies: The dependencies (like databases) that are defined as separate services in the docker-compose.yml file will be mentioned in the README.md file, so users understand the architecture of the application.

6. Docker Compose Instructions: The README.md file will contain instructions on how to use Docker Compose to run the application, which directly relates to the configuration defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
