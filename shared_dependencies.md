The shared dependencies between the "docker-compose.yml" and "README.md" files in the "LuxAi_AI-Stock-Predict_App" repository are:

1. Service Names: The names of the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file will be referenced in the README.md file to explain how to use Docker Compose to start the services.

2. Environment Variables: Any environment variables defined in the docker-compose.yml file will also be mentioned in the README.md file, as the user will need to know what variables can be set and what they are used for.

3. Ports: The ports that are exposed by the services in the docker-compose.yml file will be documented in the README.md file, so the user knows which ports to use to access the services.

4. Volumes: If any volumes are defined in the docker-compose.yml file, these will also be mentioned in the README.md file, as the user will need to know where data is stored.

5. Dependencies: The README.md file will need to mention any dependencies that are defined as separate services in the docker-compose.yml file, so the user knows what other services are required for the main application to run.

6. Docker Compose Commands: The README.md file will include instructions on how to use Docker Compose to start the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file. This will include the command to check if the docker-compose.yml file is syntactically correct.

7. Repository Name: Both files are part of the "LuxAi_AI-Stock-Predict_App" repository and will reference this name.
