This application uses Docker Compose for easy setup and deployment. Below are the instructions on how to use it.

## Docker Compose Instructions

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose on your machine.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

4. Run the following command to start the application:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This command will start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Services

The main application service is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file. This service is responsible for running the application.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure the application. These are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Ports

The application service exposes certain ports for interaction. These ports are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Volumes

Volumes are used for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. These are defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Dependencies

The application might depend on other services (like databases) which are also defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file as separate services.

Please refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file for more details on services, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies.
